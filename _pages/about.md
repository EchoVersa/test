#### A Republic. From the people, for the people.

As a Republic, we believe access to economic growth should not be a privilege. For decades banks have only offered opaque products for fat prices.

To change the system, Trade Republic has been building a digital offering from scratch since 2015. We offer a beautifully simple product everybody can afford. Yet, we are still a regulated financial institution. We secure your money and protect your wealth.

So you can save money and build your wealth with personal savings plans on ETFs and stocks. Invest in companies you love or hedge the market with derivatives easily, fast and secure.
