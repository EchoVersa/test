Introducing the first of four editions of Trade Republic's educational pills that will bring you concepts and information to help you make better decisions in the long term. And we start with...stocks.

#### What is a stock? Become an owner

Stock, stock, stock...stock! An stock share of a company's capital stock. It's the typical explanation of what shares are that we've all been given at some point and that has stuck in our brains. But what does it mean?

Apple, Amazon, Tesla... They are all publicly traded companies. And we can own them, even if only a part. Just by buying a share you will participate in the growth of their sales and profits and you will be entitled to receive their dividends. These shares are exchanged in the markets we know as stock exchanges, markets that serve to connect investors willing to buy and sell, setting a price that varies from moment to moment depending on the expectations of each participant. In Trade Republic you can buy and sell more than 7,500 shares from more than 30 countries and these were the most bought shares in Spain in March this year in Trade Republic:

On the other hand, investors' expectations and mood is not going through its best moment, and not for less, with the doubts about the economic growth that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine will leave us. But there are opportunities! We tell you about it here.

#### What's happening now?

- Global indices bounce back strongly after a difficult start to the year, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closing at more than two-month highs on Tuesday, up 1.2% and 1.8% respectively
- Hope left by Russia-Ukraine peace talks injects optimism into markets
- Economy remains strong, allowing central banks to move forward with their stimulus withdrawal process
- Fewer fears of extended economic sanctions on Russia, which have led to price rises in commodities, including energy, with oil topping $100/barrel
- Banks are the hardest hit sector, especially those with exposure to Russia
- Oil companies are up sharply so far this year

The war conflict that is developing in Ukraine after its invasion by Russia is causing a lot of nervousness in the markets these days. And not for nothing, as the economic sanctions imposed on Russia have a major effect on economies such as the  , which depend on energy imports from that country and have very close trade ties with it. News such as the temporary suspension of the activity of businesses like Inditex (ZARA) or those of Netflix, VISA or Mastercard are reflective of the delicate situation the country is facing.

Banks, especially those with exposure to the country, are being the most damaged on the trading floor while energy companies, such as oil companies, are enjoying spectacular revaluations thanks to the sharp rise in the price of oil, which already exceeds 110 dollars per barrel?. In addition, renewable energies seem set to gain importance if Europe is to achieve a greater degree of energy independence, which is driving up the share prices of stocks related to the sector. Other commodities have also soared, as is the case of nickel, whose London trading had to be suspended after rising more than 100% in a single day.

Zoom out.

Crashes like the ones we are experiencing often happen. On average, the U.S. stock market suffers a correction from annual highs of 14%. Every year. Bullish or bearish.

However, if we look at longer periods, we see how the S&P500 has an annualized return of 16% over 3 years, 12.5% over 5 and 12% over 10 years. And remember, past developments are no indicator for the future development of the stock price.
