#### What are cryptocurrencies?

A cryptocurrency is a digital asset that, as its name suggests, uses cryptographic encryption to ensure its ownership and the integrity of the transactions made with it . These coins do not exist in physical form: they are stored in a digital wallet.
Cryptocurrencies have several differentiating characteristics with respect to traditional systems: they are not regulated or controlled by any institution and do not require intermediaries in transactions. A decentralized database, blockchain or shared accounting record, is used to control these transactions.

#### What opportunities do cryptocurrencies offer?
We have all read and heard about the risks involved: hacks, high volatility, but undoubtedly there are also other great advantages that make it an asset that you should definitely stop to consider within an investment portfolio and that can be accessed through secure and CNMV-registered platforms such as Trade Republic.
Cryptocurrencies offer a new way to participate in decentralized projects that can change the future of finance as we know it, as all projects have a high volatility because they tend to be closely linked to market sentiment, but certainly can be a very interesting option to diversify your portfolio, many people see it as an asymmetric investment, ie invest money you do not need and potentially get a great benefit in case it goes well.
It is impossible to know which will be the next cryptocurrency to go "to the moon"  and that is why it is important to be well informed before investing , but without a doubt that in the future we will continue to use cryptocurrencies.
