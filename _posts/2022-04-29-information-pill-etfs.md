#### What is an ETF?

ETFs are like mutual funds, but unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs are publicly traded. In other words, they combine the asset diversification offered by a traditional mutual fund with the flexibility of entering and exiting the fund typical of an exchange-traded operation.
But what is a mutual fund? It can be defined as a collective investment institution that brings together the money of several investors to invest it in a diversified manner in a series of financial assets, such as stocks or bonds. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs are bought and sold on a secondary market, like stocks, and are therefore accessible from your own broker.
Often when you are starting to invest you do not have the money to buy several stocks and you buy only 1 or 2, which poses a concentration risk in that the negative performance of one of these stocks will have a big impact on your total investment. To avoid this, you can diversify your portfolio by buying shares of an ETF of a certain sector or index (Ibex 35, S&P 500, etc.) that interests you and invest in these "baskets" of stocks regardless of your net worth.

For example, some of the most popular ETFs are those that replicate the most well-known indexes, such as the S&P 500. For example, the Amundi S&P 500 UCITS ETF allows you to invest with little money in a weighted way in the 500 most representative US companies listed on the stock exchange. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) or Alphabet (GOOGL) are some of the stocks you can find in this index.

At Trade Republic you can buy and sell more than 1,500 ETFs. These were the most bought ETFs by users in Spain last March:
- Amundi S&P 500
- Amundi Emerging Markets
- iShares S&P 500 Information Technology Sector
- Lyxor Core MSCI World
- ETF Natural Gas

#### What's happening now?

Inflation continues to soar. Just check your electricity bill, go to the gas station or to the supermarket. While Spain recorded a rise of 9.8% in March, the US suffered its biggest increase in the last forty years after rising by 8.5%. Sectors such as consumer goods or airlines have been negatively affected, raising the prices of their products and suffering falls of up to 30% in the share price, as in the case of Starbucks (SBUX) since the beginning of the year. A situation that has led central banks to accelerate measures to contain inflation:

- The market is already discounting that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates somewhat aggressively, by 0.50% in May and with a high probability of another 0.50% in June, as can be seen in the minutes of the Fed's last meeting
- World indices close the week with losses due to doubts about economic growth, the impact of interest rate hikes or the lack of progress in resolving the war in Ukraine
- Elon Musk offers to buy 100% of Twitter (TWTR) at a valuation of $43 billion or $54.2 per share, a 54% premium over the price at which the company was trading before he announced his participation as the largest shareholder
- Netflix (NFLX) shares have plunged as much as 35% following the release of results indicating the loss of 200k subscribers during the last quarter
