#### What are derivatives?

We know with this name to financial products whose price is derived from the price of another asset called "underlying". For example, a product that fluctuates according to the behavior of the price of oil is a financial derivative in which the underlying is oil.

Derivatives are instruments that help to secure the future price of an underlying asset, in order to anticipate price variations of this product.

To explain this with a simpler example, let us imagine a supplier and a seller of coffee. The supplier fears that the price of coffee will fall, as he would like to close good deals with his customers. Meanwhile, the seller is afraid that the price of coffee will go up, which would reduce his income.

To solve this problem, the two parties sign a contract in which the supplier commits to sell a kilo of coffee at the current purchase price in 5 months' time, and the seller commits to buy it from the supplier.

Thus, the variation in price can work in favor of the seller if the price of coffee falls, or against if the price rises, benefiting the supplier. Derivatives make it possible to amplify profits, but they also increase the risk assumed, for which reason we must know the product we are dealing with very well.

Another feature offered by derivatives, unlike stocks, funds or ETFs, is to leverage our investment. Let's suppose we invest &euro;100 in a leveraged derivative x2 of oil and it goes up 20%, our profits instead of being &euro;20, would be &euro;40. What if it went down 20%? Our losses would be &euro;40.

#### Discover warrants

One of the best-known derivatives are warrants, a financial product that gives the right - but not the obligation - to buy or sell the underlying asset at a price and within a period of time established at the time of purchase. In other words, if I believe that Tesla's shares are going to rise in the next month, I could buy its shares directly in the market or buy a call option on the stock for a fraction of its price, called a premium, which will be higher the more likely it is that at the end of the chosen period Tesla will trade above a level known as a strike. Thus, if the value of the Tesla share is above that barrier, we will make a profit on the difference between the two prices.
